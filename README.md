Source code of homeworks and projects that I have written during my years at GMU.
You might notice that some files have a name "Jason" as author in a machine-auto-generated comment on top of the files. This was the name that I used on my personal laptop when I installed OS/software.

Senior design project:
iOS app was written for and run on iPhone 3GS for communicating with external customizable circuitry via Bluetooth, receiving a person's ECG signal transmitted from the external customizable circuitry, and drawing a graph for the ECG signal in real-time on the iPhone 3GS's display. This iOS app was a small portion of the senior design project. The main part was the external customizable circuitry which is irrelevant here.
Source code was written in Objective-C with BTStack integrated. BTStack was an open source Bluetooth stack written by Matthias Ringwald for a jail-breaked iOS. Note that at the time of this iOS app was written, communication via Bluetooth on iOS was limited to Made-For-iPhone (MFi) program which required approval from Apple and required an authentication chip provided by Apple once approved. Jail-breaking the iOS and using the open source BTStack were the only possible solution at the time due to time constraints.
